Eloquent JS Practice

Notes should be on the code itself, but basically I figured out most of problem 1 and 2 for chapter 6. For problem 1, I looked at the answer to figure out how to do the Math.sqrt portion. For problem 2, I looked at the answer because my code wasn't working and I couldn't figure out why. I was writing the minWidth/minHeight portions wrong and could still use practice with that. No idea how to do problem 3.

For chapter 7, problem 1 made sense but I got lost in the weeds on problem 2. Looked at the answer for problem 2 and I had no idea how he got there.
